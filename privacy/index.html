<p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how PokéBinder (the “Extension”), developed by Justin Furst (“we”, “us”, or “our”), collects and uses limited information from Twitch users. By using the PokéBinder Twitch Extension, you agree to the practices described below.
</p>

<h3>
    Information We Collect    
</h3>
<p>
    When you use the Extension, we collect the following Twitch user data:
<br>
    Twitch User ID (a unique numeric identifier provided by Twitch)
<br>
    Twitch Username (your public display name)
<br>
    No additional personal information is collected.
</p>

<h3>
        How We Use the Information  
</h3>
<p>
        We collect this information solely to:
<br>
    Track which Pokémon cards a Twitch user has collected by interacting in chat,
<br>
    Display those cards in the Extension UI linked to your Twitch username.
<br>
    We do not use your information for advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond the operation of this Extension.
</p>

<h3>
    Data Storage & Retention
</h3>
<p>
    Your Twitch ID and username are securely stored in our database to maintain your card collection. We retain this data only while the Extension is active or until you request its removal.
</p>

<h3>
    Sharing of Information
</h3>
<p>
    We do not sell, share, or rent your information to any third party. We may disclose your data only if:
    <br>
    Required by law or regulation;
    <br>
    Necessary to enforce our rights or protect users;
    <br>
    Required by Twitch for compliance with their platform policies.
</p>

<h3>
    Your Rights
</h3>
<p>
    If you'd like your Twitch data removed from the Extension, you can contact us at the email below, and we’ll delete it upon request.
</p>

<h3>
    Security
</h3>
<p>
    We take appropriate technical measures to secure the minimal data we collect. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
</p>

<h3>
        Children’s Privacy
</h3>
<p>
    This Extension is not directed at children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or store data from users under the age of 13.
</p>

<h3>
    Changes to This Policy
</h3>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We’ll revise the “Effective Date” above to reflect the current version. Continued use of the Extension after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
